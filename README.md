# Amazon Python Arbitrage

This is a fork off of my Textbook API program

TextbookAPI is an API that allows you to grab pricing data from the following sites:

  - Amazon (Including Trade-In Pricing)
  - Biblio
  - Half

# What This Does

- This program finds Arbitrage oppurtunities by comparing the pricing data from the 3 sites to the Amazon Trade In Price
